# Pythia
High quality &amp; fast true random number generator

This is a high quality fast true random number generator. This means that Pythia never ever repeats the same 
numbers again regardless of how many tests you do. This also means that it never generates any numbers in a 
predictable order no matter how many times you refresh.

Pythia solves a great problem and is by far the best solution out there.

How to use:
var my_pythia = new pythia();

Pythia API:

.generate  -  Generate a new random number.
.reset     -  Reset and enable to restart and -probably- regenerate same numbers.


Enjoy!
